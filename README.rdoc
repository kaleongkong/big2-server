  gem 'puma'
  Running via Spring preloader in process 8054
        create  app/channels/notes_channel.rb
        create  app/assets/javascripts/cable.js
        create  app/assets/javascripts/channels/notes.js
        create  app/channels/application_cable/channel.rb
        create  app/channels/application_cable/connection.rb

Communicating b/w different devices:
  Server side:
  0. install localtunnel in ruby/npm?????? (not sure if it's a factor)
  1. In application.rb: config.web_console.whitelisted_ips = '192.168.86.114' # IP of the client
  2. In development.rb: Rails.application.config.action_cable.allowed_request_origins = ['http://192.168.86.134:3000', 'http://localhost:3000'] # ip of servers
  3. starting rails with: rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 5000
  Client side:
  1. const cable = ActionCable.createConsumer('ws://192.168.86.134:5000/cable'); # use ip instead of localhost.
  2. proxy is using localhost # could also set to ip?

Production Side:
  1. make sure to apply gem 'puma' to production as well
  2. update the production.rb to include the following two lines
    # config.web_socket_server_url = "wss://funbig2apis.herokuapp.com/cable" 
    # config.action_cable.allowed_request_origins = ['https://funbig2.herokuapp.com', 'http://funbig2.herokuapp.com']
